# Facial-Dimensions-Detection
# Overview
Facial Dimensions Estimation is a Python project that utilizes OpenCV, dlib, and PIL libraries to analyze images and extract facial dimensions. The project aims to provide approximate measurements of various facial features such as width, height, and distances between key points on the face.

# Features
1. Extract facial dimensions from images using computer vision techniques.
2. Utilizes OpenCV for image manipulation and preprocessing.
3. Integrates dlib for facial landmark detection.
4. Employs PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image loading and visualization.
5. Provides functionalities to measure width, height, and distances between facial landmarks.
